- render videoob operations async
- add support for audio (http://weboob.org/applications/radioob)
- add support for images (?)
- provide a source per videoob backend
- use a single and persistent instance of videoob
- add support for queries (-c option of videoob)

Bugs
- inconsistency when browsing with "all" backends: if latest is selected graphically, the user select only Youtube's latest entry, but it fetch all
